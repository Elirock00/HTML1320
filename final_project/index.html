            <h1>Fitted Cap Culture</h1>
            <p>Fitted hats, also known as "sized hats," are a popular style of headwear that have a snug, comfortable fit. Unlike adjustable hats, which have a strap or buckle to adjust the size, fitted hats are made to fit specific head sizes. This results in a more streamlined and polished look, as the hat sits neatly on the head without any excess material or sagging. Fitted hats come in a variety of materials, including wool, cotton, and synthetic blends, and can feature a wide range of logos and designs. They are popular among sports fans, particularly for baseball teams, and are often worn as part of a casual or athletic outfit. While some people find the lack of adjustability limiting, others appreciate the clean look and precise fit of a fitted hat.</p>
