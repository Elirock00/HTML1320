        <h2>Hunter Brown</h2>
        <p>Hunter Brown was drafted in 2019 by the Astros organization. Brown made his Major League debut in the 2022 season. He played college baseball at Wayne State University. Currently he holds a win/loss record of 2-0, meaning both of his games pitched they have won. His fast ball can reach the speeds of 98 mph. The average pitch speed for this young star is 91-95 mph. With Justin Verlander moving to the New York Mets, this means that Brown will have more opportunity to show his skills in the 2023 season.</p>

        <h3>Predictions for the 2023 Season</h3>
        <p>The Houston Astros came off of one of their best seasons in the history of the organization. The emotions from the previous years championship are still fueling this team. They lost a few players, but kept a lot of the superstars. Currently the team has José Altuve, Kyle Tucker, Jeremy Peña, Yordan Alverez and Hunter Brown. So the fear of not seeing the playoffs are not a feeling for the Astros' fan base. The Houston Astros currently have the best odds to win the World Series in the 2023 season.</p>
